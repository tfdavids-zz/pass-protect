Usage:
# Retrieve or create a password
password <name>

# Optional flags:
# -n <n> Require the password to have a certain length
# -u <username> Associate the password with the given username

# Modify a password
password -m <name>

# Delete a password
password -d <name>

# Show accounts matching <name>
password -l <name>

===================================

Approach:
- Database containing names of sites, username, and individual salts
- Master password which is never stored
- Site passwords are created from salts and master password

Attacks:
- If an attacker steals the database, all they have to do is guess the master password to gain access to everything
- If an attacker steals the master password, they need to guess each salt to gain access to that service
- If an attacker recovers the plaintext of one password, they need to break SHA256 to get anything out of it

Database will eventually be encrypted with a different password
